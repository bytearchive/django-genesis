Introduction
============

This guide is ment to be used with django projects based on the django-genesis project template on Debian GNU/Linux based distributions. It will be or at least it should be updated to match the lastest stable django release (1.6.5) and the latest stable python release (3.4).

For use in production you could use the database backend you like, but this guide will cover only PostgreSQL databases for now.
